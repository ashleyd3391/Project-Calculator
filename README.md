# Project-Calculator

Live Demo

In this project, I will be creating a functional calculator with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It will contain functions for all basic math operators, as well as other javascript fundamentals.

What I learned:

<ul>
    <li>How to parse strings into numbers</li>
    <li>How to replace portions of a string</li>
    <li>How to limit decimal places</li>
</ul>
